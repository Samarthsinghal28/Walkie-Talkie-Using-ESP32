# Walkie-Talkie-Using-ESP32
The objective of this project is to design and implement a Walkie Talkie using ESP32, MAX Audio Amplifier and I2S Microphone and Speaker. Walkie Talkie is a wireless communication device that enables two or more people to communicate over a short distance. The device is widely used in various applications such as military, police, construction, event management, and many more.

# The project consists of the following components:
•	ESP32 Microcontroller
•	PAM8403 Audio Amplifier
•	I2S MEMS Microphone
•	Speaker
•	Power Supply

# Software Design:
The software for the Walkie-Talkie project is developed using the Arduino IDE. The program is written in C++ language. The program includes the following functions:
•	Initializing the I2S interface for the microphone and speaker
•	Setting up the MAX Audio Amplifier
•	Reading and processing the audio signal from the microphone
•	Transmitting the audio signal over the wireless communication protocol ESP-NOW
•	Receiving the audio signal from the other Walkie Talkie device
•	Playing the received audio signal on the speaker
